      <description>What are the Dolomites? When I told people that I was leaving or had been in the Dolomites they had no idea what they were, the truth is that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know it until, a couple of years ago, my mother mentioned that she would like to visit them.
In short, the Dolomites is a mountain range that is part of the Alps. It is located in northern Italy in the provinces of Belluno, Bolzano, Trento, Udine and Pordenone.</description>

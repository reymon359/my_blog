      <description>GraphQL Hello World Server The main purpose of this server-client Node.js project is to help other people to understand how GraphQL exposes the data from the Server and the Client fetches it, therefore I have tried to make it as simple as possible. And by the way, in case you want to dive into the code of the project you can find it here.
Now, going straight to the point: GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed and open-sourced by Facebook to speed up the request process.</description>
